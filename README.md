# Federacy

Federacy is a cryptoeconomic protocol and decentralized platform for security research and vulnerability management.

## Summary

[SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md) contains our thoughts and research about why change is necessary. 

## Contributing

Ultimately, we hope to design an open protocol, open source infrastructure, and an openly governed organization in order to form a strong coalition of security-minded people and companies, with the objective of improving the state of security. 

Weâ€™d really value help thinking through the ramifications of different design choices as well as whether we're focused on the right problems to tackle.
